# Pact-JS + Karma running in rastasheep/alpine-node-chromium:6-alpine issue

This repo illustrates the problem that the pact-mock-server can't run in this container.

I've tried the solution offered at https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-ruby-standalone/wiki/Using-the-pact-ruby-standalone-with-Alpine-Linux-Docker but without success.

## Run
```
docker build .
```
